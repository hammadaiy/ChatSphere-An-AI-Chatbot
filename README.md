# 🌐 ChatSphere - An AI Chatbot

A modern AI chat application that connects with LM Studio to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience using your local models.

## Live Demo

Check out ChatSphere in action! Experience the interface and features without installation through my hosted demo version.  
(If the AI isn't responding, it could be because my PC is off (the server's on my machine) or... maybe I'm just taking a nap!😁).
